# Java-Editor
Java Editor developed in java with the concept of Reflection.In java, when we want to know the class names from name of package or if we want to know the the class methods from class name or any object of class, Then we can use concept of Reflection.
In this code, I had used the same concept. When you press'.', then whatever line which can be typed after '.' will be displayed in the list.And you have to just click on the list.And you can also use this Java Editor as Notepad.All the functions of this java editor are same as microsoft notepad.
